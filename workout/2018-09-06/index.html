            <p><b>THE</b> Conventions of a number of the States, having at the time of their adopting the
            Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its
            powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as 
            extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best ensure the
            beneficent ends of its institution. 
            </p>
            
            <p><b>RESOLVED</b> by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
             America, in Congress assembled, two thirds of both Houses concurring, that the
             following Articles be proposed to the Legislatures of the several States, as amendments
             to the Constitution of the United States, all, or any of which Articles, when ratified by
             three fourths of the said Legislatures, to be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of
             the said Constitution; viz.
             </p> 

            <p><b>ARTICLES</b> in addition to, and Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of
            America, proposed by Congress, and ratified by the Legislatures of the several States,
            pursuant to the fifth Article of the original Constitution.

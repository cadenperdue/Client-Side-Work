    <h2 id = "biography"> Brief Biography </h2>
    <p> My name is Caden Perdue, I was born in Lexington, <abbr title="North Carolina">NC</abbr> on March 27 <sup>th</sup> 1997. I went to <abbr title="Southwest Elementary School">SWES</abbr>
        until I was in 3<sup>rd</sup> grade, then my family moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina and I started attending Midway
        Elementary School. We lived a happy suburban life in a fairly nice neighborhood where I filled my days riding 
        bikes and running through the woods with my friends. </p>
    <p> I eventually moved up to <abbr title="North Davidson middle school">NDMS</abbr> 
        where I began to cultivate my interest in computers and how they actually worked. I took an elective class there
        where I was introduced to robotics, flight simulators, and other various pieces of technology that captured my 
        interest. It was at this point in my life that I realized I wanted my future to be centered around some kind of 
        science <s>or engineering</s>. </p>
    <p> By the time high school came around I found myself spending my nights playing video games with my friends, and drinking lots of H<sub>2</sub>O. By
        the end of high school it had become very clear to me that I wanted to study Computer Science for the rest of 
        life. In 2015 I decided to further my education at Appalachian State University where I am currently a senior. </p>
    <h2 id = "goals"> Career Goals </h2>
    <p> As for the future of my career, I would, of course, like to apply my Computer Science skills to my job. For now
        my main goal is to simply find somewhere to work, preferably somewhere relatively close by so that I don't have
        to make a huge move to a new state. After a few years of saving money and plannig my future I hope to find a job
        in Cyber Security or Web Development somewhere out west. Ideally I will immediately find a company that I have a strong 
        drive to work for where I will be able to move my way up the ladder and become an expert in my field. </p>
